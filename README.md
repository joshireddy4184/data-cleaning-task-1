#  Bike Sales Data Cleaning  

## Project Overview  
This repository contains the **Bike Sales dataset**, which was cleaned and prepared for further analysis. The raw dataset had missing values and duplicate entries, which were corrected using Excel.  

## Files in this Repository  
- **uncleaned bike sales data.xlsx** → Original raw dataset with blanks and duplicate rows.  
- **cleaned_bike_sales_dataset.csv** → Cleaned dataset after processing in Excel.  

## Cleaning Steps Performed  
1. **Removed duplicate rows** to ensure unique records.  
2. **Filled missing/blank values** with appropriate replacements:  
   - `"Unknown"` for text fields  
   - `0` for numeric fields  
3. **Standardized formatting** for consistency (trimmed spaces, corrected entries).
